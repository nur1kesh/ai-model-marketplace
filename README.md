## Smart Contract Integration

The marketplace uses two main smart contracts:

1. **ERC-20 Token Contract**
   - Handles token transfers for purchases
   - Manages token approvals and balances

2. **Marketplace Contract**
   - Manages model listings
   - Handles purchases
   - Stores ratings and reviews
   - Controls model ownership

## Security Considerations

- All transactions require MetaMask confirmation
- Smart contract interactions are protected by ownership checks
- Token approvals are required before purchases
- Multiple security validations for listing and purchasing
- Wallet connection state is preserved securely
